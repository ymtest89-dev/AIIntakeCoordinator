# 🎤 AI Voice Intake Revolution 
## The End of Contact Forms (Finally!) 
> *"Contact forms are where customers go to die. This hackathon brought them back to life with voice."* 🧟‍♂️➡️😊

Ever tried hiring an intake coordinator for a business? Yeah, good luck with that! 😅 During the hackathon, I built an AI Intake Co-ordinator Powered by Vapi, Strand Agents, Anthropic Claude, Neo4j and Weaviate. Slide deck by Gamma and code with Claude Code and Codex.
